# !!! NEWS !!! AI Companion: GPT-3.5 Turbo inside Excel ü§ØüöÄ
After creating the video, I realized it would be an excellent idea to make this feature more accessible. As a result, I included the AI Companion feature in the free version of the MyToolBelt add-in. The AI Companion leverages the even more powerful GPT-3.5 Turbo model, making it easier than ever to integrate cutting-edge AI technology directly into your spreadsheets.
